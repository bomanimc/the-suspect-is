Scott, of Montgomery county, about three miles below Vernon, did on Friday last, the 19th instant, steal a remarkable likely bright mulatto negro woman, named Polly, about twenty years old, light colored hair, inclined to curl a little; she has a prominent nose, a flesh mole on her left eye-brow, some months advanced in pregnancy; they will no doubt travel as man and wife, as they lived in that way for several months.--She is inclined to be fleshy, and from his tender care of her this summer, would without particular notice pass as a white woman.--Harvy was raised a few miles above Augusta, in the state of Georgia, and is about five feet eight or nine inches high, dark complected, with a bushy head of hair, quite black and small whiskers, a large beard for a man of twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, thin visage, light built, has blue eyes, and a very down look, with heavy eye-brows. Fifty dollars will be paid for apprehending the woman so that I get her, and two hundred upon conviction of the thief. Harvy was the overseer of Major T.B. Scott until the 1st inst. at which time he paid him off, and discharged him. Major T. B. Scott, having business in Nashville, Tennessee, for which place he set out from Cahawba on the 19th inst. JOHN SCOTT. Cahawba, July 22, 1822. N.B. Said Harvy purchased in Cahawba a small dark brown horse, five years old, two or three white feet, with a star in his forehead and long switch tail, quite wild and very active. Also a small white mare poney, with a remarkably small crop tail--possibly, however, he may have changed one or both of his beasts. J.S. aug. 1--m From the circumstance of her taking away with her a number of articles of men's clothing, the above described woman will doubtless attempt to travel in the character of a man--perhaps as a brother of Harvy, as he acknowledged her as such in the flat at White's ferry on the Alabama river, between Vernon and Selma; she would probably represent a man near the size of Harvy, being a large woman. They will undoubtedly endeavor to reach the free States of the Ohio river, or some of the Spanish Territories-- She likewise has with her a number of women's clothes. Previous to his leaving Cahawba, Harvy purchased a wide brimmed white hat, and an old man's saddle with a new pad, the kentle worn out.

FROM information received, a man by the name of George W. Harvy; after loitering a few days about the plantation of Major Thomas B. Scott, of Montgomery county, about three miles below Vernon, did on Friday last, the 19th instant, steal a remarkable likely bright mulatto negro woman, named Polly, about twenty years old, light colored hair, inclined to curl a little; she has a prominent nose, a flesh mole on her left eye-brow, some months advanced in pregnancy; they will no doubt travel as man and wife, as they lived in that way for several months.--She is inclined to be fleshy, and from his tender care of her this summer, would without particular notice pass as a white woman.--Harvy was raised a few miles above Augusta, in the state of Georgia, and is about five feet eight or nine inches high, dark complected, with a bushy head of hair, quite black and small whiskers, a large beard for a man of twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, thin visage, light built, has blue eyes, and a very down look, with heavy eye-brows. Fifty dollars will be paid for apprehending the woman so that I get her, and two hundred upon conviction of the thief. Harvy was the overseer of Major T.B. Scott until the 1st inst. at which time he paid him off, and discharged him. Major T. B. Scott, having business in Nashville, Tennessee, for which place he set out from Cahawba on the 19th inst. JOHN SCOTT. Cahawba, July 22, 1822. N.B. Said Harvy purchased in Cahawba a small dark brown horse, five years old, two or three white feet, with a star in his forehead and long switch tail, quite wild and very active. Also a small white mare poney, with a remarkably small crop tail--possibly, however, he may have changed one or both of his beasts. J.S. aug. 1--m From the circumstance of her taking away with her a number of articles of men's clothing, the above described woman will doubtless attempt to travel in the character of a man--perhaps as a brother of Harvy, as he acknowledged her as such in the flat at White's ferry on the Alabama river, between Vernon and Selma; she would probably represent a man near the size of Harvy, being a large woman. They will undoubtedly endeavor to reach the free States of the Ohio river, or some of the Spanish Territories-- She likewise has with her a number of women's clothes. Previous to his leaving Cahawba, Harvy purchased a wide brimmed white hat, and an old man's saddle with a new pad, the kentle worn out.

STOP THE RUNAWAYS. ON Monday night, 17th June, inst. two fellows, ROBIN and JANUARY, ran away from Timothy H. Keeler, with whom the subscriber had put them to work on his mills. Robin is about five feet nine inches high, a very likely fellow, thin made and of dark complexion, sensible and well spoken, plays the fiddle well, and is a carpenter by trade. January is about five feet six inches high, (a brother to Robin,) is of the same complexion, but not as likely, and has rather a surly down look, is equally artful and plausible, has some of his upper front teeth decayed, and some out; he also plays the fiddle well, and is a carpenter by trade. Robin rode off a sorrel mare, which he had been indulged in using. January it is believed stole off a horse; both of them had a variety of clothing, therefore it would be unnecessary to attempt a description. Robin was purchased at the sale of the property of Charles Brunson, in May, 1821, who then left this state, and is said to be living in the state of Alabama. January has a wife living at the plantation of Thomas Wells, and has been much indulged in visiting there; he was bought by Jos. & Daniel D. Richbourg from Richard Ridgill (?) who has also removed to the state of Alabama, where it is most expected that both Robin and January are endeavoring to go, by passes forged of their freedom, by some villian or villians, who it is suspected have collogued (?) with them to go off as they have been heard to express, that they had been offered certificates of freedom by certain persons to inveigle them to leave their owner It is expected that they will go by way of Columbia, and probably spend some days there, as they have acquaintance at Mr. Graham's there, that it is believed would countenance and secret them. The subscriber is determined to have them advertised throughout the U. States, and to expend double their value, but that he will have them apprehended, in order to detect the villain who has forged their passes and inveigled them off, that a proper example may be made of him. One hundred dollars will be paid for the delivery of these negroes to the subscriber, if taken within this state; and if taken in the state of Alabama, three hundred dollars reward will be paid for their delivery to J. B. Richardson. Sumpter Dist. S. C. June 20, 1822. N. B. Recent information states that the Negroes mentioned above are in Wilcox County, near Canton, in the state of Alabama, and in the possession of Charles Brunson and Richard Ridgill, who may attempt to remove them still further west, and may dispose of them, and thus impose stolen property on an innocent purchaser.

Mr. Taylor sold him to Mr. Slater, living near the New Kent and James City line, who in consequence of removing to Alabama, left him, and when re-taken was sold to John M. Gregory, Esq., of Williamsburg, Va., and afterwards purchased by his present owner, from Thomas McCargo & Co., of Richmond. Nothing was heard of him until last November, (1837) when I was informed he had been taken and put in New Kent jail, but afterwards made his escape by burning out, and has not since been heard of. Wilson is about 5 feet 6 inches high, slender made, bushy  head, dark yellow colour, pleasing countenance, and about 36 years old. the above reward will be paid for his apprehension, and placed in any jail in the State or United States, so that I can obtain him again.

Also a small white mare poney, with a remarkably small crop tail--possibly, however, he may have changed one or both of his beasts. J.S. aug. 1--m From the circumstance of her taking away with her a number of articles of men's clothing, the above described woman will doubtless attempt to travel in the character of a man--perhaps as a brother of Harvy, as he acknowledged her as such in the flat at White's ferry on the Alabama river, between Vernon and Selma; she would probably represent a man near the size of Harvy, being a large woman. They will undoubtedly endeavor to reach the free States of the Ohio river, or some of the Spanish Territories-- She likewise has with her a number of women's clothes. Previous to his leaving Cahawba, Harvy purchased a wide brimmed white hat, and an old man's saddle with a new pad, the kentle worn out.

He is a likely well set Fellow, 28 or 30 years of age, and about 5 feet 6 inches high, and has had the Small� Pox. He has a Variety of Clothes, some of them very good, and effects to dress very neat and genteel, and generally wears a Wig. He took with him two or three Coats or Suits, a dark brown or Chocolate coloured Cloth coat, pretty much worn, a dun or Dove coloured cloth, or fine Frize, but little worn, and a light blue grey Summer Coat of Grogam, Camblet, or some such stuff, a Straw coloured Waistcoat, edged with a Silver Cord, almost new; and several other Waistcoats, Breeches, and Pair of Stockings; a blue Great Coat, and a Fiddle. His behavior is excessively complaisent, obsequious, and insinuating; he speaks good English smoothly and plausibly, and generally with a cringe and a smile, he is extremely artful, and ready at inventing specious pretences to conceal villanous Actions or Designs. He plays on the Fiddle, can read and write tolerably well, and understands a little of Arithmetic and Accounts. I have reason to believe some evil minded Persons in town have encouraged and been Accomplices in his villanous Designs; it is probable he will contrive the most specious forgeries to give him the appearance of a free man: I have already been informed of a Writing he has shown for that Purpose and by which means he has imposed upon many people; who may all be easily satisfied he has no legal claim to freedom, even from slavery, nor any pretence, but by the very law which he is my servant for 40 years, as the record of the court at New Haven will witness. At that place where the former Owner of the said Slave lived, he was guilty of various Crimes and Felonies, for which he was several times publickly whipped, and only escaped the Gallows by want of Prosecution. When he became my servant I intended to have him shipped to the West Indies and sold him there, and kept him in prison till I should get an Opportunity, but on his earnest request solemn Promises of his Good Behavior, and seeming Penitence I took him into my Family upon trial, where for a Time he behaved well and was very servicable to me. Decieved by his seeming Reformation, I placed some Confidence in him, which he has villanously abused; having embezzled Money sent him to pay for Goods, borrowed money and taken up goods in my Name unknown to me, and also put on his own Account, pretending to be a Freeman. By this villanous proceeding I suppose he has collected a considerable Sum of Money; I am also apprehensive that he has been an Accomplice in some of the late Robberies commited in and near this City. Whoever will take up the said Servant and bring him to me or secure him in some of his Majesty's Gaols so that I can have him again, if taken up in the City of New York shall have Five Pounds reward and greater, if taken up at a greater Distance. Any persons who take him up are desired to be careful and to bring him before the Magistrate, and have him well searched, leaving all the Money and Goods found upon him except the necessary he has on in the Hands of the Magistrate, and to be very watchful against an Escape, or being deceived by him, for he is one of the most artful of Villains.

STOP THE RUNAWAYS. ON Monday night, 17th June, inst. two fellows, ROBIN and JANUARY, ran away from Timothy H. Keeler, with whom the subscriber had put them to work on his mills. Robin is about five feet nine inches high, a very likely fellow, thin made and of dark complexion, sensible and well spoken, plays the fiddle well, and is a carpenter by trade. January is about five feet six inches high, (a brother to Robin,) is of the same complexion, but not as likely, and has rather a surly down look, is equally artful and plausible, has some of his upper front teeth decayed, and some out; he also plays the fiddle well, and is a carpenter by trade. Robin rode off a sorrel mare, which he had been indulged in using. January it is believed stole off a horse; both of them had a variety of clothing, therefore it would be unnecessary to attempt a description. Robin was purchased at the sale of the property of Charles Brunson, in May, 1821, who then left this state, and is said to be living in the state of Alabama. January has a wife living at the plantation of Thomas Wells, and has been much indulged in visiting there; he was bought by Jos. & Daniel D. Richbourg from Richard Ridgill (?) who has also removed to the state of Alabama, where it is most expected that both Robin and January are endeavoring to go, by passes forged of their freedom, by some villian or villians, who it is suspected have collogued (?) with them to go off as they have been heard to express, that they had been offered certificates of freedom by certain persons to inveigle them to leave their owner It is expected that they will go by way of Columbia, and probably spend some days there, as they have acquaintance at Mr. Graham's there, that it is believed would countenance and secret them. The subscriber is determined to have them advertised throughout the U. States, and to expend double their value, but that he will have them apprehended, in order to detect the villain who has forged their passes and inveigled them off, that a proper example may be made of him. One hundred dollars will be paid for the delivery of these negroes to the subscriber, if taken within this state; and if taken in the state of Alabama, three hundred dollars reward will be paid for their delivery to J.

Scott, of Montgomery county, about three miles below Vernon, did on Friday last, the 19th instant, steal a remarkable likely bright mulatto negro woman, named Polly, about twenty years old, light colored hair, inclined to curl a little; she has a prominent nose, a flesh mole on her left eye-brow, some months advanced in pregnancy; they will no doubt travel as man and wife, as they lived in that way for several months.--She is inclined to be fleshy, and from his tender care of her this summer, would without particular notice pass as a white woman.--Harvy was raised a few miles above Augusta, in the state of Georgia, and is about five feet eight or nine inches high, dark complected, with a bushy head of hair, quite black and small whiskers, a large beard for a man of twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, thin visage, light built, has blue eyes, and a very down look, with heavy eye-brows. Fifty dollars will be paid for apprehending the woman so that I get her, and two hundred upon conviction of the thief. Harvy was the overseer of Major T.B. Scott until the 1st inst. at which time he paid him off, and discharged him. Major T. B. Scott, having business in Nashville, Tennessee, for which place he set out from Cahawba on the 19th inst. JOHN SCOTT. Cahawba, July 22, 1822. N.B. Said Harvy purchased in Cahawba a small dark brown horse, five years old, two or three white feet, with a star in his forehead and long switch tail, quite wild and very active. Also a small white mare poney, with a remarkably small crop tail--possibly, however, he may have changed one or both of his beasts. J.S. aug. 1--m From the circumstance of her taking away with her a number of articles of men's clothing, the above described woman will doubtless attempt to travel in the character of a man--perhaps as a brother of Harvy, as he acknowledged her as such in the flat at White's ferry on the Alabama river, between Vernon and Selma; she would probably represent a man near the size of Harvy, being a large woman. They will undoubtedly endeavor to reach the free States of the Ohio river, or some of the Spanish Territories-- She likewise has with her a number of women's clothes. Previous to his leaving Cahawba, Harvy purchased a wide brimmed white hat, and an old man's saddle with a new pad, the kentle worn out.
