"TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.
Ranaway from the Subscriber, at Barnwell Court Hourt, on the 12th September, TENAH, a female servant, about 22 years of age, of the middle size, and rather light complected, tho' denominated a black.
Tenah was bought in this city in June last, at a sale of the estate of Vance's Negroes, and was taken into the country as a nurse for the summer season. As she has many connexions in this place, and a husband, (a free man, by the name of William Lewis,) living on Goose Creek, it is likely she is harboured in or about the two places; tho' some suspicion is entertained that she many have made her way towards Columbia in this State, where it is understood a former husband was taken and now resides. The above reward will be paid on her apprehension and delivery to the Master of the Work House, with proof that she is harboured either by a free person or slave; and Ten Dollars for her delivery at any jail in the State so that I can get her.

"$500 REWAR,
For Davy and Clem.
RANAWAY from the subscriber, six miles west of Nashville, some time in December last, a negro man named DAVY, about thirty five years old, purchased at the sale of Col. John Stump, last fall. Said fellow is about five feet ten inches high, black complexion, pock marked, the whites of his eyes not a very clear white. I will give two hundred dollars to any person who will deliver said fellow to me, and pay all reasonable expenses if apprehended on the west side of the Ohio river, and one hundred dollars and all reasonable expenses if on the east side of the river, and out of the state of Tennessee; and fifty dollars if within this state.

The other fellow, named CLEM, about twenty five or thirty years old, ranaway on Saturday night last. He is a very remarkable fellow, and one in whom I had placed great confidence, having traveled with me through several of the states, and descended the Ohio from Pittsburgh. He no doubt will aim to cross the Ohio immediately, as the only inducement he could have for running away must be to gain his freedom. He is a black fellow, at least six feet high, remarkably well made, except having very large feet, is broad across the cheek bones; his eyes rather smaller and farther in his head than  common, his head, above the eyes, smaller than usual for a fellow his size. He has wrestled a great many times, and was never thrown by black or white, and but seldom beat at running or jumping. He took with him a furred hat, somewhat worn, a broad cloth coat of Spanish brown color, a velvet round about, I think, of a dark color, a dark pair of pantaloons, twilled, perhaps, of cotton and wool. I will give $300 and all reasonable expenses for delivery of said fellow to me, if caught on the west side of the Ohio river, and $150 if caught on the east side.

I have been informed he is on horseback, but the description of the horse is not known to me. The following is the description of the saddle and bridle: the saddle is old, and torn across the seat, the stirrup leathers are not fellows, the one being broader than the other; the irons are old, and not alike; the saddle is covered with a buffaloe robe; and cut so as to hit the tree behind; the bridle is a small curb plated bit; the reins are chewed, and have been buckled in at the bit; the head stall is black.

"Five pounds reward, run away on Monday the 12th instant from me the subscriber, a Mulatto Servant man named Charles, and known by the name of Charles Roberts, or German. He is a likely well set Fellow, 28 or 30 years of age, and about 5 feet 6 inches high, and has had the Smallý Pox. He has a Variety of Clothes, some of them very good, and effects to dress very neat and genteel, and generally wears a Wig. He took with him two or three Coats or Suits, a dark brown or Chocolate coloured Cloth coat, pretty much worn, a dun or Dove coloured cloth, or fine Frize, but little worn, and a light blue grey Summer Coat of Grogam, Camblet, or some such stuff, a Straw coloured Waistcoat, edged with a Silver Cord, almost new; and several other Waistcoats, Breeches, and Pair of Stockings; a blue Great Coat, and a Fiddle. His behavior is excessively complaisent, obsequious, and insinuating; he speaks good English smoothly and plausibly, and generally with a cringe and a smile, he is extremely artful, and ready at inventing specious pretences to conceal villanous Actions or Designs. He plays on the Fiddle, can read and write tolerably well, and understands a little of Arithmetic and Accounts. I have reason to believe some evil minded Persons in town have encouraged and been Accomplices in his villanous Designs; it is probable he will contrive the most specious forgeries to give him the appearance of a free man: I have already been informed of a Writing he has shown for that Purpose and by which means he has imposed upon many people; who may all be easily satisfied he has no legal claim to freedom, even from slavery, nor any pretence, but by the very law which he is my servant for 40 years, as the record of the court at New Haven will witness. At that place where the former Owner of the said Slave lived, he was guilty of various Crimes and Felonies, for which he was several times publickly whipped, and only escaped the Gallows by want of Prosecution. When he became my servant I intended to have him shipped to the West Indies and sold him there, and kept him in prison till I should get an Opportunity, but on his earnest request solemn Promises of his Good Behavior, and seeming Penitence I took him into my Family upon trial, where for a Time he behaved well and was very servicable to me. Decieved by his seeming Reformation, I placed some Confidence in him, which he has villanously abused; having embezzled Money sent him to pay for Goods, borrowed money and taken up goods in my Name unknown to me, and also put on his own Account, pretending to be a Freeman. By this villanous proceeding I suppose he has collected a considerable Sum of Money; I am also apprehensive that he has been an Accomplice in some of the late Robberies commited in and near this City. Whoever will take up the said Servant and bring him to me or secure him in some of his Majesty's Gaols so that I can have him again, if taken up in the City of New York shall have Five Pounds reward and greater, if taken up at a greater Distance. Any persons who take him up are desired to be careful and to bring him before the Magistrate, and have him well searched, leaving all the Money and Goods found upon him except the necessary he has on in the Hands of the Magistrate, and to be very watchful against an Escape, or being deceived by him, for he is one of the most artful of Villains.
